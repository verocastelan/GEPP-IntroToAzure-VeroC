● Once you finish the description of the services of the previous point, now add a
new section in the same document and create a list of the main tools/software
that you use in your work everyday.
● Using the list of services above, add a category indicating whether the tool is a
Paas, Saas or IaaS.
● Finally, add a new section in the same document, check the list of services that
you use everyday and try to map all the services that you could use in the azure
cloud instead of your current tools and try to answer the following questions:
○ Does my tool have an equivalent service in the cloud?
○ If yes, which one? What things are equal, what others are different?
○ If not, is there any other similar service? What things are equal, what
others are different?
